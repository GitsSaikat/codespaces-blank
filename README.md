  <b>üõ£Ô∏è Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Tool</b><br>
</h1>


Welcome to the **Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Tool for Highways and Airports**! This application is designed to assist engineers and researchers in designing and evaluating pavement structures based on traffic, material, and environmental data. 

**The app is available at:** [https://pavement-design-app.streamlit.app/](https://pavement-design-app.streamlit.app/)


---

## üöÄ Features

- **Input Data**: Upload or manually input traffic, climate, subgrade, and material data.
- **Pavement Design**: Define pavement layers, material properties, and costs.
- **Simulation**: Analyze pavement performance under various conditions.
- **Lifecycle Cost Analysis (LCCA)**: Evaluate the economic efficiency of pavement designs.
- **Results Visualization**: View performance predictions, cost analysis, and pavement design details with interactive charts.
- **Report Generation**: Create and download detailed reports in PDF format.

## Usage

**Input Data**: Either upload your data using an Excel file or manually enter all the required data to proceed with the design.
    -   **Excel File**: Make sure your Excel file contains sheets named 'Traffic', 'Climate', 'Subgrade' and 'Materials' with the correct columns. See instructions on the page.
    -   **Manual Entry**: Alternatively, fill the forms with the respective data fields, in which the comma separated values are supported in axle loads inputs.

**Design Pavement**: Define the pavement layers by entering the number of layers and then configure the type and thickness of each one.

**Run Simulation**: Set initial costs, maintenance costs, discount rate, and analysis period to run the pavement simulation and LCCA.

**View Results**: Analyze the simulation results, lifecycle cost, and pavement design details through tables and charts.

**Generate Report**: Create a comprehensive PDF report of your analysis.
